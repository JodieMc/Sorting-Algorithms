# Sorting-Algorithms
A Java application to benchmark five different sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Counting Sort, Insertion Sort, QuickSort, and Selection Sort. 
The application includes implementations of the five sorting algorithms with a method to test them. 
The running time for each algorithm is measured ten times, and the average for each algorithm and each input size is output to the console when the program finishes. 
The project contains a report including information on sorting algorithms, the process followed when implementing the application, and a discussion on the results of the benchmarking.
